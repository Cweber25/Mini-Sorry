# Problem Definition: The game consists of a board that is 14 spaces long. The first space is START, the last is HOME,
# and in between are labelled 1 through 12. There is a deck of 13 cards which includes four 1s
# and 3 each of 2,3,4. The playerâ€™s token starts at the START space and a card is drawn from the
# shuffled deck. The token moves that many spaces toward HOME. Play continues drawing a card
# and moving forward. However, the token must reach the HOME space by exact count, so if a
# card is drawn that would move the token beyond HOME, then the token does not move. The
# deck of cards is not drawn between draws, but if all 13 cards are used then the deck is shuffled
# and play continues.
