# Problem Definition: The game consists of a board that is 14 spaces long. The first space is START, the last is HOME,
# and in between are labelled 1 through 12. There is a deck of 13 cards which includes four 1s
# and 3 each of 2,3,4. The playerâ€™s token starts at the START space and a card is drawn from the
# shuffled deck. The token moves that many spaces toward HOME. Play continues drawing a card
# and moving forward. However, the token must reach the HOME space by exact count, so if a
# card is drawn that would move the token beyond HOME, then the token does not move. The
# deck of cards is not drawn between draws, but if all 13 cards are used then the deck is shuffled
# and play continues.

import random

import statistics 

# Call the game function to get the average amount of turns it takes to get to the home space.
def main(): 
   # Amount is the amount of games it takes to get to the home space. Change it to calculate any amount you want.
   amount = 1000000
   totalArr = [] * amount
   for x in range(amount):
       totalArr.append(miniSorry())

    # Prints out the calculations using import statistics mean and standard deviation
   print(" The mean amount of turns is", statistics.mean(totalArr))
   print(" The standard deviation amount of turns is", statistics.stdev(totalArr))

    # This loops through the code to check to see what spot the piece is at
    while(spot != 13):
        # Chooses a random card from the deck and moves the piece

        spot += ran
        # If the number were to move past home then it returns to previous location and removes card from deck
