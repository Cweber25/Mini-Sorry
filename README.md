Problem Definition: The game consists of a board that is 14 spaces long. The first space is START, the last is HOME, and in between are labelled 1 through 12. There is a deck of 13 cards which includes four 1s and 3 each of 2,3,4. The playerâ€™s token starts at the START space and a card is drawn from the shuffled deck. The token moves that many spaces toward HOME. Play continues drawing a card and moving forward. However, the token must reach the HOME space by exact count, so if a card is drawn that would move the token beyond HOME, then the token does not move. The deck of cards is not drawn between draws, but if all 13 cards are used then the deck is shuffled and play continues.

These programs are set to run simulations of the game for whatever amount you enter. It then returns all the specific data from each game.
